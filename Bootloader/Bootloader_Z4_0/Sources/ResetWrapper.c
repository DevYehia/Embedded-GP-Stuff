/*
These bits provide the target chip mode to be entered by software programming. The mechanism to enter
into any mode by software requires the write operation twice: first time with key, and second time with
inverted key. These bits are automatically updated by hardware while entering SAFE on hardware
request. Also, while exiting from the STOP0 modes on hardware exit events, these are updated with the
appropriate RUN0â€¦3 mode value.
